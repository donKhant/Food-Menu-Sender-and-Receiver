 * From inventory, you can confirm to send the orders to another application.
 *
 * Developer Guide
 * The app fetchs and display data from Firebase Realtime Database.
 * It uses Sqite to temporarily store the data.
 * When the user confirms that the orders will be sent,
 * the app will retrieve and transfer data from local database to Firebase db.

Why use Firebase and Sqlite? I don't want to send
the orders right away to another app. I want a confirmation stage.
To solve that, I could have used a boolean to check for.
I have done that before.
This time, I am using Sqlite because I can!
